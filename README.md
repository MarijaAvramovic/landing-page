# landing-page
For this project  I ll be creating an entire web page.

I modified and substituted my own content into this design. The image used instead of the placeholder, the creator of the image - website Pixabay.

Tru project I used commit early & often.

Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

The website has 4 main sections (and a footer).

First I added all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. 

Using only one CSS file.

Reference project flexbox exercises Odin Project. 
Project is not moblie responsive per TOP instructions. 

I published my project in order to upload solution to odin landing-page project.


*I had to revise flex property multiple times. 
flex 1, flex wrap check if responsive

so far it took me 3,5 hr for landing page

looking forward to check solution and then learn how to branch and change content so landing page has my own content.
